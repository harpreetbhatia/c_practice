// 	Both Merge-sort and Quick-sort have same time complexity i.e. O(nlogn). In merge sort the file a[1:n] was divided at its midpoint into sub-arrays which are independently sorted and later merged. Whereas, in quick sort the division into two sub-arrays is made so that the sorted sub-arrays do not need to be merged latter.
