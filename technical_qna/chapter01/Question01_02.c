// The solution to this is to copy the data from the next node into this node and delete the next node!. Ofcourse this wont work if the node to be deleted is the last node. Mark it as dummy in that case. If you have a Circular linked list, then this might be all the more interesting. Try writing your own C program to solve this problem. Having a doubly linked list is always better.
